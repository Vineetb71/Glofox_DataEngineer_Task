### Introduction
A simple job developed in python 3.0 which provides you with a word dictionary and an inverted index based on a collection of documents.

### General info
The basic criteria behind this job is to build an inverted index of the documents so that it can speed up calculations. Based on the task and being jon snow who is passionate about information search and data engineering this tool is built which can be used by various search engine where just by entering the word we can identify that this word is present in how many dcouments. This actually sounds interesting as this tool can create a word dictionary (mapping of word and word id) as well as an inverted index which maps each word id to a document id. So just by searching a word it will tell you in which document or a list of documents this word exists.

### Technologies

Task is created with:

* Python version: 3.0
* Testing .txt files created in sublime text.
* Tools used : Jupyter notebook and spyder to execute the python script

### Setup
* Any tool such as spyder/Pycharm can be used to run the python script.
* Installation guide to install spyder : https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/installation.html
* Easiest way is to install anaconda navigator and use spyder from that.
* To test the functionality of the code some testing files are uploaded in the "Testing_Files" folder. All the files are with '.txt' extension same as original       dataset.
* The code is tested on the original datasets as well but just to include test cases these are attached in the repository.
* 'Glofox_Test.py' is the executable file for spyder or jupyter notebook which is included in the repository.
* All these text files and the 'Glofox_Test.py' file should be placed in the same directory on local machine so that it can be executed without much changes in the   path of directory required in the code.
