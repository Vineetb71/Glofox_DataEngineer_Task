# Glofox_DataEngineer_Task

The test is completed in python language. The file named "Glofox_Test.py" is uploaded in the repository which contains the solution of the coding challenge.
To test the functionality of the code some testing files are uploaded in the "Testing_Files" folder. All the files are with '.txt' extension mentioned for the original datasets.
The code is tested on the original datasets as well but just to include test cases I have attached the test files.

All these text files and the 'Glofox_Test.py' file should be placed in the same directory on local machine so that it can be executed without much changes in the path of directory required in the code.
